# Hadoop
This is WordCount Example that you can gain hint about Hadoop grammers.
But this is very bad-smell code to understand code what they do.

first count and get 5 people who has many telephone_record from data.txt
second get 4 of location most call those 5 people
third get all of people those 4 of location who call

I use three Job instance and MultipleInput to join their output and input

maybe i'll refactoring them later
